Goals
* Understand the steps and methodologies that are needed to translate musical melody notes into a time-series data structure that is amenable to statistical analysis, making best use Python, R and other software tools.
* Estimate and evaluate a first-order Markov chains model using a pooled set of melodies as training data
* Extend the methodology to estimate second- and higher-order transition probability matrices.
* Create a methodology that used the estimated transition probability matrices to select
	the best fitting major and minor musical key signature when applied to new test data
	(melodies not in the training data).
* Compare key identification results from the Markov structures to results from using
	the simple relative frequency of notes for a selected key (a stationary distribution).
* Compare MC results with unstructured neural network methods and results.
* Consider a hybrid methodology that combines the features of Markov Chains and Neural Nets.
* Compare to existing software tools for key detection.
